## 1. Project Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.
In this project, demographic data from an email database of a German company will be analyzed, comparing them with data from the general population.

We have two main challenges:
Understand how the customer base relates to the general population base;
Make a prediction of the propensity of customers to respond to emails that the company sends.

For the first challenge, a customer segmentation technique will be used with the creation of population clusters and with that we will replicate to the customer base and understand how the two are similar.

For the prediction challenge, we will test a series of algorithms to understand which one can better predict customers who might respond to emails through AUC and recall metrics.
